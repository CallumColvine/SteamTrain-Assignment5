Task Scenarios

1st. 
    James gets home from work, and feels like playing some games. He starts up his computer and sees that 3 of his friends are already online. James calls his friends on Skype and the 4 of them decide to play games together. James’ friends are getting tired of arguing over what to play that they all own. Whenever a good suggestion comes up, they realize one friend doesn’t own that game. James opens the Steam with Friends and enters his login information. Steam with Friends delivers a list of James’ friends and allows him to select the 3 friends he is playing with. Steam with Friends then displays a list of all the games James can play with the friends he selected. James picks a game out of the list, and his friends agree on that game. They all start it up, with much time saved. 

2nd.
	Ariel is at school, on her laptop working on her assignment for english. Her phone vibrates, as she receives a notification. She checks her phone, and sees a notification from her friend Susanne via Steam with Friends Mobile. The notification from Susanne is asking Ariel to play Team Fortress 2 at 7:00 pm. Ariel clicks the “Accept” button, and a notification is sent back to Susanne letting her know Ariel has accepted. When Ariel gets home at 5:45 pm, she knows she will have time to make dinner since she already established when she’s meeting Susanne. She sits down with a glass of wine right at 7:00 and avoids any confusion or frustration because of using Steam with Friends Mobile. 

3rd. 
	James is having a relaxing day off. He’s been gaming quite a bit already today, and he takes a short break to grab some tea. While making the tea James remembers the raise he got at his work last week, and decides to reward himself with a new game from Steam. James opens up Chrome and goes to the Steam with Friends web app. He clicks on the “Recommended Games” tab and takes a look through the list, excited that he will get to play more games with his friends. After browsing the list, he picks a game that 2 of his best friends also own. James now buys the game on Steam and begins the download. While James waits, he heads to the kitchen and grabs another cup of tea, pleased with his purchase.

How to Run

All HTML and CSS files are included. The first file that should be opened is named "login.html". 

Testing was done in Google Chrome

NOTES:

Not all buttons on the main page are functional
    -To navigate to "Buy More Games" , "Manage Events", and "Notifications" you     will have to open the respective HTML files manually (Steamtrain -             BuyPage.html, Steamtrain - EventsPage.html, and notification.html)
    -There is no button to the "Settings" page currently. It was not included       in test scenarios and was considered to be less important. It can be opened     manually by opening "settings.html"
    
I was unsure of functionality from a group member's work so both "Match Games with Friends" and "Match Friends by Game" buttons lead to the same page.
